- LSTM network models are a type of recurrent neural network that are able to learn and remember over long sequences of input data. They are intended for use with data that is comprised of long sequences of data, up to 200 to 400 time steps.

- The CNN model learns to map a given window of signal data from each axis Accelerometer where the model reads across each window of data and prepares an internal representation of the window.

- The CNN LSTM model will read subsequences of the main sequence in as blocks, extract features from each block, then allow the LSTM to interpret the features extracted from each block.
